To set up your App Icon:

1.  Place your icon image in this folder and name it `icon.png`.
    -   Recommended size: 1024x1024 pixels.
    -   Format: PNG.
2.  Open the terminal in the project root.
3.  Run the following command:
    `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons`

This will automatically generate the app icons for both Android and iOS.
